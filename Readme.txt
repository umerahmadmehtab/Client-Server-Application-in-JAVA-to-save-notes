Description:
In this lab, I created a client-server Java program, where client sends server a username and his notes. The server records them and saves it. Server moreover, offers client to search for any existing username and his notes.

Working:
The server starts listening to a port number (<65536), in this case it is (8001). The Client requests the server for a connection and the server will accept it. For a new record, the client asks for username and notes and then sends it server. For retrieval case, the client asks for username and inreturn provides all entries against it.

How to Run:
-	Run the server.
-	Run the client and follow the menu.
-	To end, First end the server then client.
  

Compile Used:  NETBeans IDE
